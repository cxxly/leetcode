# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

## Problem

Say you have an array for which the i<sup>th</sup> element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

## Solution
动态规划：
```
profit[i] = profit[i-1]  if price[i]-min <= profit[i-1]
          = price[i]     if price[i]-min > profit[i-1]

min = min price[j] （j<=i)
``` 
**java**
```java
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE, profit = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<prices.length; i++) {
            if (prices[i]<min) 
                min = prices[i];
            if(prices[i]-min > profit) 
                profit = prices[i]-min;
        }
        return profit;
    }
```
